I've been a software developer for a long time (about 18 years at this point), and I recognize how valuable your DCR podcasts are. I get a lot of value from them even with my experience, but I really wish I could send them back in time to my past self. My stepson is just starting to go to a community college to study computing, and I'm going to try to convince him to listen to all those DCR episodes. They're worth their weight in gold (not such a good analogy considering they're weightless bits :)).
