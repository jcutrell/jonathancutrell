Jonathan approaches every situation with the mindset of a leader. He’s not striving to get better for the sake of improvement, but to grow and help others grow. Whether it’s within his own life, family, or career, Jonathan thinks in multiple lanes, always making sure to push others alongside or slightly ahead, gaining momentum as he does. As a colleague I’m further along as a person and a professional because I had the opportunity to work alongside him.
