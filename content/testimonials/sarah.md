Jonathan is a very thoughtful developer and interaction designer whose attention to detail
is evident in everything I’ve seen him produce. On top of that, he’s kind, patient,
and willing to help others learn and do well. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend
Jonathan to anyone and, given the opportunity, I’d be happy to work with him again myself.
