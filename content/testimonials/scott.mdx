Jonathan is an **inordinately skilled developer and technical architect merged with a consummate client service professional.** He has an **uncanny ability to strike several balances at once.** He patiently serves up all the technical detail you want at the level of detail you can manage, yet shields you from complexity when you want the bottom line; and never patronizes in any of it. He gives you a sense that you can **trust his decisions implicitly, yet he’s generously and eagerly collaborative** and receptive to any ideas from others. He prioritizes user experience and business value over maximalism. And along the way, he’s funny, well-read, curious, and confidence-boosting.
