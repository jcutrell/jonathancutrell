I started listening to your podcast.. hm, maybe 5 weeks ago or so - and it has been life changing. If you only knew how valuable the information is to a new aspiring developer like me.

I feel that I gain perspective on things I previously struggled with, among many other enriching improvements from listening to Developer Tea.

Youâ€™re doing us all a noble service with your podcast and I thank you for it.
