I've known Jonathan for years, since I was a teenager.
We first met when he was giving guitar lessons in my hometown,
and he was my teacher. He had the same go-getting,
need-to-know-everything drive concerning music that I did.
It wasn't until years later after we had both graduated
college that we reconnected, and learned that we had both
become full-time developers. I've sought counsel from Jonathan,
collaborated on ideas with him, and referred him to others due
to his incredible work ethic, personality, and skill.
I recommend Jonathan with the highest possible regard.
