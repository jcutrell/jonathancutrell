As a leader, I am most impressed by Jonathan's constant pursuit of learning and desire to help others through mentorship. While he has always excelled at his work, his goal has never been merely completing a task; it is the continued personal development of both him and the people he works with.
Jonathan lacks the ability to partially complete a task. He insists on thoroughly understanding and solving each problem holistically.
