Although Jonathan contains a wide variety of skillsets to create solutions, and diverse topical and technical knowledge to provide counsel, his greatest strength is his ability to connect with others through **active listening and thoughtful question-asking.** I can say from personal experience that he has been **instrumental in helping me shape my own problem-solving process** through intentional challenges to my approach and assumptions. Plainly stated, Jonathan is the type of person who wants to serve and make those around him better at their craft â€” and his life reflects that in every aspect.
