As a leader, I am most impressed by Jonathan's **constant pursuit of learning** and desire to help others through mentorship. While he has always excelled at his work, his goal has never been merely completing a task; it is the **continued personal development for both his self and the people he works with.**
Jonathan lacks the ability to partially complete a task. He insists on thoroughly understanding and solving each problem holistically.
