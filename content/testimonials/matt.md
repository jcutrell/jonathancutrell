It was a great pleasure to have had the opportunity to work under the management of Jonathan. He’s an extremely thoughtful, inventive leader, able to empathize with the complexities of development tasks. Jonathan has a keen way of assessing multiple solutions to a given problem and discerningly selecting the best candidate. Aside from the specifics of management or software development, and probably more importantly, he’s just a kind enjoyable person to be around and work with.
