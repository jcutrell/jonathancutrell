A non-zero amount of back pressure is applied to certain consumer market goods because the otherwise would-be buyers because of some fear of that thing being found once they have died without having had a chance to dispose of the thing. Which also suggests there is some market for people who would “clean up” on condition of your death or incapacitation. Not like estate planning - more like embarrassment insurance.
