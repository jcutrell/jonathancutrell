Monday night football - in order to be at the game, you’re one of two people: either you are local and this is what you do on Mondays, or you traveled to be there, meaning you have both the disposable income to travel and put it into a ticket, AND you have a job where you don’t have to work on a Monday. The result? A bunch of locals and white collar workers in face paint screaming together, and the blue collar class watching them from home or the break room at work. I wonder if the beer costs more in the stadium on a Monday night, and if the commercials cost less to buy than on a Sunday.
