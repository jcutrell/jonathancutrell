### Formal definition:

In sensory perception, the concept of "just noticeable difference" is the minimum amount of change in some sensory input that is noticeable to the sensor. Weber's law states that this value changes based on the baseline intensity, and that there is a linear relationship between the threshold difference and the baseline intensity.

Formally:
```
delta I / I = K
```

Where `delta I` is the incremental change in intensity sufficient to be the just noticeable difference; K is a constant that is determined on a per-person basis.

For example, a given person may have a K-value of `.1` for differences in weight. When holding a 2lb weight, they will not be able to notice the difference between a 2lb weight and a 2.1lb weight (K = 0.05), but they would notice anything greater than 2.2lbs (K = 0.1).

The insight that Weber's work brings is that as the baseline intensity increases, the "just noticeable difference" increases in linear fashion based on the individual's constant `K` ratio. In other words, the higher the weight value, the less likely the person will recognize a larger difference. (A 200lb weight with a K=0.1 would have a JND of 20lbs).

### How it applies
This kind of sensory relativity can be applied in so many ways in our lives.

Of course in direct sensory experiences this is applicable - not only in weight signals, but also in signals like sound or temperature. Notably, the `K` value may not be the same for _all_ senses.

Weber's law is one of many fundamental principles that underscore the fact that humans use relative (rather than absolute) measures more inutitively. More specifically, it seems that our sensitivity and attention is calibrated to some baseline relativity. If the baseline is set at, say, a decade, talking about the impact of one week will be much smaller than if our baseline is set at a month.

This implies that there is an imperative to understand *how* the baseline is determined in a given circumstance, so you understand the context your brain is comparing in. We can also use these tendencies to our advantage (see: [[Anchoring]]).
