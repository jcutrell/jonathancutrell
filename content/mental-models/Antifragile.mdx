A term that describes something that gets better with stress.

Generally, living beings are considered antifragile.

In direct contrast, something fragile breaks easily under stress.

Of note, this designation is not the same as being resilient; resilient
means remaining close to an equilibrium under stress.

Anti-fragility is marked specifically by _improvement_ under stress.
