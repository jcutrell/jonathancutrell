Tyranny of small decisions is what happens when individuals make decisions that seem rational
for themselves, devoid of how those decisions may affect a shared interest.

This is particularly relevant when talking about climate change. Each small decision a person makes to reuse a plastic bag or take public transit doesn't have an enormous appreciable affect on the state of our climate. However, in sum, these decisions _do_ have an enormous effect.
