The concept of headwind comes from aviation. A headwind is a prevailing
wind in the opposite direction of travel that results in an identical
airspeed but a slower groundspeed.

This model is a useful way of thinking about progress of a team. A team
may be performing as usual, but a force outside of their control is making
progress much slower than if the force was not present.

Similarly, a _tailwind_ is the opposite; an external force that allows
lower effort for equivalent progress.

Finally, a _crosswind_ is a force that creates a discrepancy between your
_heading_ and your _direction of travel_. In order to maintain a particular
course, you may have to "correct" for the crosswind.

All of these models are useful when thinking about where energy is being spent,
what prevailing forces are present, and how they are managed.
