Benefits of scale is illustrated simply by the phrase "you have to have money
to make money." Multiple mechanics are at play for benefits of scale, and they
are often multiplicative.

For example, with large enough scale, you may no longer have to spend as much
of your resources on recruiting talent, advertising your brand, or establishing
a production pipeline.

Scale is also important particularly for litigation; because a single lawyer or
small team of lawyers can represent a huge corporation in a given legal case,
the resources needed to fight individual suits are often miniscule in comparison
to the resources brought by the prosecution.

The mental picture of the benfits of scale is an exponential graph, where opportunity
is exponentially correlated with capital scale.
