### Optimize for the Long-Term; Always Be Ahead Of The Ball

When you optimize for the long-term, a lot of other problems naturally resolve.

Optimizing for the long term means valuing:

<ul style={{ columns: 3 }}>
  <li>People over products</li>
  <li>Character over skills</li>
  <li>Trends over spikes</li>
  <li>Norms over exceptions</li>
  <li>Teaching over showing</li>
  <li>Philosophy over tactics</li>
  <li>Habits over heroics</li>
  <li>Smooth over fast</li>
  <li>Data over anecdotes</li>
  <li>Impact over hype</li>
  <li>Causes over symptoms</li>
</ul>

This isn't intuitive because it can be scary. You might have to give up short-term wins that would prevent long-term growth.

Being optimize for the long-term doesn't mean you ignore the short term. It means you change the short term _in light of the long term._
