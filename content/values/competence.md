### Competence

This is a value I only recently was able to put a specific descriptor to; I grew up thinking I loved "learning" or "academics." But in fact, what I'm drawn to is competence. With the same origin as _competition_ - I see this as a method of competing against my own standard.

I enjoy doing things that I am able to become competent at, but I very much don't enjoy things I can't build competence in.

This might sound universal, but in reality there are plenty of things people enjoy doing with little to no competence. (The prime example for me is karaoke. I would rather sleep.)
