### Prioritize High Leverage

I see this value as a balancing value to "grit." While some people prefer hard work and action-orientation, I would much rather take my time, work on building systems and holistic approaches.

This means I may avoid or delegate things that are not high leverage.

Leverage is dynamic, though; in a given situation, a mundane task may have high leverage, where in another context that same task may have little to no leverage at all.
