notes:
  Nearly every non-fiction book I've appreciated in the last 10 years has referenced _this_ book. I have a standing offer to purchase this book for virtually anyone who will commit to reading it.
  If you can deal with the length of the book, the lessons it will teach about how our thinking is fundamentally biased as humans will change the way you view information. This book is responsible for a whole new way of thinking for me.
