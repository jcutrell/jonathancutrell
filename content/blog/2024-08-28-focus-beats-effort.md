**Correct focus outpaces brute efforts and long hours.** The perennial problem of productivity is almost never solved with "more." It's easy but incorrect to imagine that our productivity is based solely on our ability to drive output. More correctly, it is based on our ability to develop laser focus on the right things. Thus the vast majority of my management style is not focused on driving people to "work harder" (which almost always roughly translates to "more hours"). It is instead pointed at generating the clearest possible focus. The marginal gains in productivity seen by driving more hours are almost never worth the damage done to peoples' mindset and feeling of buy-in. If your team can't be successful within normal working hours, one of a few things must be true, in order of most to least likely.

- You are not focusing on the right things
- You are not planning effectively
- You have a talent or capability issue
- You have a motivation / willingness issue

How can it be that these are in this order? Based on pure statistics and reasoning we can arrive at this conclusion.

Focusing means finding the right problems to solve; this could be a problem that goes as high as the fundamental market positioning of your company, or as low as a ticket prioritization issue.
