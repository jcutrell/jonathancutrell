It's in every engineering leader's job description: "hold people accountable."

Accountability is a funny thing to use as a critical skill for a high level leader, because in many ways the core of what this is saying is "do the job."

Let's talk about the message under the message here a bit; what are these companies really looking for when they say you need to hold people accountable?

Let's imagine a scenario to play this out.

We have an imaginary EM Marcus. Marcus is responsible for three teams who are delivering work on critical projects.

Each team has a few engineers and a product manager. Marcus is responsible for reporting on the team's progress.

Teams A and B are smooth sailing. Team A is brand new with onboarding engineers, so they don't have a significant project on their plates other than getting up to speed. Team B is well staffed and their project is running along slightly ahead of schedule.

Team C, though, is struggling. They are under-resourced, and their project is running behind by a couple weeks.

So, where and how does accountability show up in this picture? I'm going to present three different forms of accountability and how it applies to the situation.
