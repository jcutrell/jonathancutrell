I recently did a talk on some of the concepts in the book I'm working on. The talk really helped clarify some of the ideas I want to share with the world, and I'm sharing that talk with you today. Specifically, I discuss why our perception of creativity as it relates to logic is wrongly constructed, and a better way to understand our differences.

Hope you enjoy!
