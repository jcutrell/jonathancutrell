Put them on happy.”\n\nOur son Liam has started saying this about a few routines we do together. In this case, putting his clothes on.\n\nHe’s approaching 3 years old now, but sometimes teaches me lessons I'd expect from a much older, wiser person.\n\nWhen we read a book to him before bed, my wife and I sometimes have the urge to speed through. To complete the task, move on to the next thing.\n\nThis constant rush because we feel there is something more important to get to. Something is always next, always around the corner.\n\nLiam seems to know something that I feel deeply: that happiness is very often about slowing down on purpose. Happiness is about being here, now.\n\nRead the book slowly, emphatically. Read every word, see every picture, enunciate. Give life to your moment, no matter how mundane.\n\nDon't go fast. Go happy.\n","permalink":"values/go-happy","slug":"go-happy","readingTime":"1 min read"},{"title":"Giving Is Sharing; Sharing Is Giving","date":"2022-12-14T11:00:00.000Z","author":"Jonathan Cutrell","id":"value-giving-is-sharing","content":"\n### Giving Is Sharing; Sharing Is Giving\n\nI've always enjoyed giving to others, but it was only recently that I realized that it's not just a philanthropic reward my brain is seeking.

(For the record, this did not happen.)\n\nCultivating _understanding_ isn't just about academics, nor is it strictly about feelings.\n\nUnderstanding is about an integrated picture, accounting for all dimensions of the truth.\n\nWisdom, feeling, intuition, data, experience, logic - all are a part of understanding.\n\nThe secret: Having understanding often leads you to realize how little you know, and how reliant you are on experimentation, collaboration, and iteration.\n","permalink":"values/cultivate-understanding-in-context","slug":"cultivate-understanding-in-context","readingTime":"1 min read"},{"title":"Competence","date":"2022-12-14T11:00:00.000Z","author":"Jonathan Cutrell","id":"value-competence","content":"\n### Competence\n\nThis is a value I only recently was able to put a specific descriptor to; I grew up thinking I loved \"learning\" or \"academics.\" But in fact, what I'm drawn to is competence.
